In this homework, you will be implementing a language detection module using the ngram knowledge you learned in Week 1. Given a string representing some natural language utterance, your program should be able to predict whether the text is Indonesian, Malaysian or (phonetically transcribed into English) Tamil. So given the following three strings:

Semua manusia dilahirkan bebas dan samarata dari segi kemuliaan dan hak-hak.

Semua orang dilahirkan merdeka dan mempunyai martabat dan hak-hak yang sama.

Maitap piiviyiar cakalarum cutantiramkav piakkiaar

â€¦ an ideal program should output/predict the following labels for the strings:

malaysian Semua manusia dilahirkan bebas â€¦ indonesian Semua orang dilahirkan merdeka â€¦ tamil Maitap piiviyiar cakalarum cutantiramkav piakkiaar â€¦

Build and test your language models (LMs)

You should run your program to build and test your LMs in this format:

$ python3 build_test_LM.py -b input-file-for-building-LM -t input-file-for-testing-LM -o output-file

where input-file-for-building-LM is a file given to you that contains a list of strings with their labels for you to build your ngram language models, input-file-for-testing-LM is a file containing a list of strings for you to test your language models, and output-file is a file where you store your predictions.

Evaluate your predictions

To evaluate the accuracy of your predictions, you run the evaluation file eval.py which is given to you:

$ python3 eval.py file-containing-your-results file-containing-correct-results

where file-containing-your-results is the output-file from the build and test step, and file-containing-correct-results is a file containing the correct string labels.

For example, in the homework package, you are given several files, including a skeleton build_test_LM.py, eval.py, input.train.txt, input.test.txt, and input.correct.txt. To build and test your LMs, run:

$ python3 build_test_LM.py -b input.train.txt -t input.test.txt -o input.predict.txt which will store your predictions in input.predict.txt. To evaluate your predictions, run:

$ python3 eval.py input.predict.txt input.correct.txt which prints the accuracy of your predictions.

Whatâ€™s expected in build_test_LM.py?

The python program build_test_LM.py is given to you as a skeleton script. You are required to complete this script by implementing the build_LM() and test_LM() functions.

[(â€˜Sâ€™, â€˜eâ€™, â€˜mâ€™, â€˜uâ€™), (â€˜eâ€™, â€˜mâ€™, â€˜uâ€™, â€˜aâ€™), (â€˜mâ€™, â€˜uâ€™, â€˜aâ€™, â€˜ â€˜), (â€˜uâ€™, â€˜aâ€™, â€˜ â€˜, â€˜mâ€™), (â€˜aâ€™, â€˜ â€˜, â€˜mâ€™, â€˜aâ€™), (â€˜ â€˜, â€˜mâ€™, â€˜aâ€™, â€˜nâ€™), (â€˜mâ€™, â€˜aâ€™, â€˜nâ€™, â€˜u), (â€˜aâ€™, â€˜nâ€™, â€˜uâ€™, â€˜sâ€™), â€¦ ]

Labels | 4-grams | 4-grams | 4-grams â€”â€”â€”â€” | â€”â€”â€”â€”- | â€”â€”â€”â€”- | â€”â€”â€”â€”- â€¦ | â€¦ (â€˜eâ€™,â€™mâ€™,â€™uâ€™,â€™aâ€™) | (â€˜mâ€™,â€™uâ€™,â€™aâ€™,â€™ â€˜) | (â€˜uâ€™,â€™aâ€™,â€™ â€˜,â€™mâ€™) â€¦ malaysian | 3.11e-07 | 1.03e-07 | 2.07e-07 indonesian | 5.17e-07 | 2.07e-07 | 1.52e-07 tamil | 2.89e-06 | 5.17e-07 | 9.65e-07

To test a new string, you should multiply the probabilities of the 4-grams for this string, and return the label (i.e., malaysian, indonesian, and tamil) that gives the highest product. Ignore the four-gram if it is not found in the LMs.

Format of the input/output files

input.train.txt: the input file for you to build your LMs, which contains about 900 lines, where each line is a label/string pair separated by a space. The label will either read malaysian, indonesian, or tamil. input.test.txt: the input file for you to test your LMs, which contains 20 strings, each in a line. A small number of strings have been inserted by extraterrestrial aliens, and do not belong to any of the three languages your program is asked to detect. This is just to keep it interesting; you can tell us what language you think they are, and see whether you can tune your program to tell us that they are other languages.

input.correct.txt: contains the correct labels for the input in input.test.txt, in the same format as input.train.txt (i.e., each label/string pair is separated by a space).

Your output file from build_test_LM.py (e.g., input.predict.txt): contains your predictions in the same format as input.train.txt.

Essay questions:

1. In the homework assignment, we are using character-based ngrams, i.e., the gram units are characters. Do you expect token-based ngram models to perform better?

2. What do you think will happen if we provided more data for each category for you to build the language models? What if we only provided more data for Indonesian?

3. What do you think will happen if you strip out punctuations and/or numbers? What about converting upper case characters to lower case?

4. We use 4-gram models in this homework assignment. What do you think will happen if we varied the ngram size, such as using unigrams, bigrams and trigrams?

Submission Formatting

For us to grade this assignment in a timely manner, we need you to adhere strictly to the following submission guidelines. They will help us grade the assignment in an appropriate manner. You will be penalized if you do not follow these instructions. Your student number in all of the following statements should not have any spaces and all letters should be in CAPITALS (inclusive of the ending check letter). You are to turn in the following files:

A plain text documentation file README.txt (e.g., in UPPERCASE): this is a text only file that describes any information you want us to know about your submission. You should give an overview of your program and describe the important algorithms/steps in your program. However, You should not include any identifiable information about your assignment (your name, phone number, etc.) except your student number and email (we need the email to contact you about your grade, please use your [u|a|g|e]*******@u.nus.edu address, not your email alias). This is to help you get an objective grade in your assignment, as we wonâ€™t associate student numbers with student names. Any source code (in particular, build_test_LM.py for this homework assignment): We will be reading your code, so please do us a favor and format it nicely.

(Optional) A plain text file ESSAY.txt that contains your answers to the essay questions (if you choose to attempt the questions). Again, do not disclose any identifiable information in your essay answers.

These files will need to be suitably zipped in a single file called &lt;student number&gt;.zip. Please use a zip archive and not tar.gz, bzip, rar or cab files. Make sure when the archive unzips that all of the necessary files are found in a directory called &lt;student number&gt;.

Grading Guidelines

The grading criteria for the assignment is tentatively:

50% Correctness of your code

20% Documentation

5% For following the submission instructions and formatting your documentation accordingly.

5% For code level documentation.

10% For your high level documentation, in your README document.
